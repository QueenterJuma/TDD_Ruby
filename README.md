# TDD Ruby

In this project you will implement a class with some methods, but you will do it by doing test-driven development (TDD). Remember that the idea is to write tests first and then the code. This will be verified in your commits history, so it is important to use the proper sequence.

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Add method factorial to calculate the factorial for any positive number greater or equal to 0**
- **Add a reverse functionality to reverse a string**
- **Create a method called fizzbuzz that takes one argument, an integer N, and returns a string. The returned string is constructed following these rules:**
  - When N is divisible by 3, return "fizz".
  - When N is divisible by 5, return "buzz".
  - When N is divisible by 3 and 5, return "fizzbuzz".
  - Any other case, return N as a string (e.g. say N is 7 then return "7").
